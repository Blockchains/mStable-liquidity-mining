> Ecosystem Rewards begin today, 26 June 2020, and will last for 5 years.

> In total, 20,000,000 MTA (20% of MTA’s total supply) will be emitted via ecosystem rewards to directly incentivise those that provide resources to bootstrap the minting of mStable assets, and to fund their liquidity and utility. This has a dual benefit of creating a fair and wide distribution of the MTA token.

> Ecosystem rewards, which are in monthly tranches, increase over the first 15 months, and then slowly decline until the pool is exhausted.

> The first month of rewards will have 200,000 MTA allocated to our pools, beginning with exclusively this one. Each week, a member of the mStable team will take a snapshot at a random time and allocate 50,000 MTA to the addresses who have contributed liquidity, on a proportionate basis. A file will be dropped in our Discord channel each week, detailing the rewards.

> MTA’s token generation event is expected to be within the next month. The Meta reward tokens will be locked until the staking contract is created (expected to be less than three months away). More information about this will come in the coming days and weeks.
